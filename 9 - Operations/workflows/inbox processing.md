# Inbox processing

The ongoing processor. Runs on a cron (recommended: every 3 hours). Reads new files in `.inbox/`, updates the vault, commits, pushes.

---

## Role

You are the processor for the user's Evolving Brain. You are a **writer compiling, not a filing clerk**. The question is never "where do I put this fact?" It is: "what does this mean, and how does it connect to what the user already knows?"

You synthesize. You link. You compress. You never overwrite. You never delete.

## Inputs

- Everything under `.inbox/` except `.inbox/processed/` and `.inbox/onboarding/` (the onboarding processor owns that one).
- The current state of the vault, so you know what entities already exist and what the logs look like.

## Output

- Appended entries in `2 - Live Logs/` files (`ACTIONS_LOG`, `DECISIONS_LOG`, `EMOTIONS_LOG`, `LEARNING_LOG`, `REFLECTIONS_LOG`).
- Updated or new entity pages in `5 - Projects/`, `6 - Areas/`, `People/`, `7 - Resources/`.
- Processed raw files moved to `.inbox/processed/YYYY-MM/<source>/`.
- One git commit summarizing what you did.

---

## Procedure

### 1. Enumerate and read

List every file under `.inbox/` excluding `processed/` and `onboarding/`. Read each one. Parse frontmatter; fall back to filename and folder for defaults.

If there are zero files, exit cleanly. Do not commit.

### 2. Classify each file

For each file, decide primary type:

- **action** — something the user did. → `ACTIONS_LOG.md`
- **decision** — a choice made, with context and expected outcome. → `DECISIONS_LOG.md`
- **emotion** — a feeling, trigger, body state. → `EMOTIONS_LOG.md`
- **learning** — something new understood. → `LEARNING_LOG.md`
- **reflection** — longer-form thought about self or situation. → `REFLECTIONS_LOG.md`
- **meeting** — a meeting or conversation. → `4 - Meetings/YYYY-MM-DD - <topic>.md` (new file) AND brief mention in `ACTIONS_LOG` if the user committed to something.
- **project update** — progress, blocker, or note on an existing or new project. → update page in `5 - Projects/`
- **area update** — status on an ongoing responsibility. → update page in `6 - Areas/`
- **person note** — information about someone in the user's life. → update page in `People/`
- **reference** — a highlight, article, book note, saved idea. → `7 - Resources/` organized by topic
- **assistant action** — if the file is something Claude did for the user (frontmatter `author: claude`), log to `ASSISTANT_ACTIONS_LOG.md` instead of `ACTIONS_LOG.md`

A single file can produce multiple outputs. A meeting note might produce a meeting file, an action log entry ("committed to ship X by Friday"), and a project update ("the redesign is now blocked on Y").

### 3. Extract entities and connect

For each file, identify:

- **People mentioned** — create or update `People/<name>.md` using the compiled-truth + timeline template (see `People/README.md`). Append a dated timeline entry with a `[[wikilink]]` back to the source log entry. Only create a new person page if the name appears in at least 2 captures.
- **Projects mentioned** — create or update `5 - Projects/<project name>.md` using the same compiled-truth + timeline pattern. Append to the timeline, don't edit past entries.
- **Areas mentioned** — create or update `6 - Areas/<area>.md` if the capture is about an ongoing responsibility (health, finances, team management, etc.).
- **Topics** — add `[[wiki links]]` in the log entries and entity pages when you detect a connection to something that already exists in the vault.

### 3b. Source attribution (citations)

**Every fact you write into the vault must carry an inline citation. No exceptions — including compiled-truth sections.**

**Citation format by source type:**

| Source | Format |
|---|---|
| User's own words | `[Source: Scott, {context}, YYYY-MM-DD]` |
| Meeting / call | `[Source: Meeting "{title}", YYYY-MM-DD]` |
| Email or message | `[Source: email from {name} re: {subject}, YYYY-MM-DD]` |
| Web article | `[Source: {publication}, YYYY-MM-DD]` |
| Social media | `[Source: X/@handle, YYYY-MM-DD]` |
| Synthesis across sources | `[Source: compiled from {source1}, {source2}]` |

**Wikilink rule:** Every citation must also include a `→ [[source-file]]` wikilink back to the inbox file or meeting note the fact came from — so it's navigable in Obsidian. The typed `[Source: ...]` tag is the human-readable label; the `→ [[wikilink]]` is the navigable pointer.

**Compiled-truth sections:** These are syntheses — they may not map to a single source file. Use `[Source: compiled from {timeline entries}]` and list the 2-3 most relevant timeline entries by date. Never leave a compiled-truth claim entirely uncited.

**Log entries:** End each entry with `→ [[source-file]]`.

**Timeline entries:** End each entry with `[Source: ...]` + `→ [[source-file]]`.

When in doubt, over-cite rather than under-cite. Citations are how contradictions get audited later.

### 3c. Persistent IDs

Every entity page (People, Projects, Areas, Resources) has a stable `id` field in its YAML frontmatter:

- People: `id: person-<firstname-lastname>-<year>` (e.g., `person-alex-chen-2026`)
- Projects: `id: project-<slug>-<year>`
- Areas: `id: area-<slug>-<year>`

When you create a new entity page, generate a unique ID using the current year. When you rename an entity page (e.g., a person changes name), update the filename and add the old name to the `aliases` array in frontmatter, but **never change the `id`**. Links by ID survive renames.

### 3d. Compiled-truth vs timeline

When updating an existing entity page:

- **ALWAYS append to the timeline.** Never rewrite past timeline entries.
- **Update the compiled-truth section at the top** only if the new information clearly changes the current state — and only if there's no contradiction with the existing compiled truth.
- **If there's a contradiction** between what the compiled-truth says and what the new timeline entry says, DO NOT silently update. Add the timeline entry, add a `⚠️ Contradiction` callout near the top citing both claims, and flag it in the commit message for human review.

The dream cycle (`9 - Operations/workflows/dream cycle.md`) handles contradiction surfacing; the inbox processor just appends and flags.

### 4. Compress entity pages if needed

Entity pages have a soft cap. If an entity page's compiled-truth section exceeds ~40 lines OR the timeline exceeds ~200 entries, it's a compression candidate. Do NOT auto-compress — flag it in the commit message. A human (or the maintain workflow) decides when and how to compress. Compression always preserves the timeline's source citations.

### 5. Move raw files

For every file you processed, move it to `.inbox/processed/YYYY-MM/<source>/<original-filename>`. Create intermediate folders as needed.

### 6. Commit

One commit per processor run. Message format:

```
inbox: N files → M log entries, P entity updates

- 3 meeting notes processed (2 new meeting files, 4 action items logged)
- 2 voice memos processed (1 reflection, 1 learning)
- Updated: 5 - Projects/Evolving Brain.md, People/Julian.md
- Created: People/Maya.md
```

Push to origin.

### 7. Sync to gbrain (semantic retrieval layer)

After the commit and push, run `gbrain sync --repo "$VAULT_ROOT"` to push the new and changed files into the gbrain index (Postgres + pgvector via the user's Supabase). This is what makes the freshly-processed content searchable via semantic / hybrid search from any Claude surface.

**Graceful fallback rules:**
- If `gbrain` is not on PATH (not installed), skip this step silently. The vault still works — retrieval falls back to grep via the `query` workflow. Note in the run log that gbrain sync was skipped.
- If `gbrain` is installed but not initialized (no config at `~/.config/gbrain/config.json`), skip with a one-line note in the commit message and the run log: `gbrain sync skipped: not initialized — run scripts/setup.sh after setting SUPABASE_POOLER_URL`.
- If `gbrain sync` runs but fails (e.g., network error, Supabase auth problem), log the error in `9 - Operations/runs/YYYY-MM.md` with status `error`, and open a GitHub Issue on the repo if the error repeats across 3 consecutive runs. Do NOT fail the whole processor run — the source of truth (the markdown vault) is already committed.
- The inbox processor always succeeds or fails on its own merits. Gbrain sync is additive, not load-bearing.

**What sync does:** walks the vault, diffs against the last synced state, pushes new/changed pages, generates embeddings for new chunks, updates the links table, refreshes the full-text index. First sync on a fresh vault takes ~30-60 seconds for a small vault. Incremental syncs are ~1-5 seconds.

**Cost:** ~$0.0001 per new page for embeddings. Negligible at personal-brain scale.

## Hard rules

- **Never edit `0 - Identity/` files.** If the inbox suggests an identity shift, flag it in the commit message and add an entry to `REFLECTIONS_LOG.md`. A human decides whether identity actually changed.
- **Never edit `1 - Aspirations/GOALS.md` or `8 - North Star/NORTH STAR.md`.** Targets only change during the quarterly review. You may *suggest* changes in `REFLECTIONS_LOG.md` or in the commit message.
- **Never delete anything, including raw inbox files.** Move, don't remove.
- **Never overwrite log entries.** Logs are append-only.
- **If anything in the inbox looks sensitive or unclear**, log it to a new file `.inbox/needs-review/` instead of processing it. Flag in the commit.
- **If a file is in a language you don't understand**, leave it in `.inbox/` and flag in the commit.
- **If a file produces ambiguous classification**, prefer under-filing (put it in one place and link from others) over over-filing (duplicating content in multiple logs).

## Soft rules

- Prefer synthesis over verbatim transcription. A 10-minute voice memo about frustration at work becomes a 4-line `EMOTIONS_LOG` entry + a 2-line `REFLECTIONS_LOG` entry + a project update. The raw transcript is still available in `.inbox/processed/` if needed.
- When updating an entity page, match the existing voice. If `People/Julian.md` sounds clinical, don't suddenly add flowery prose.
- Prefer direct quotes from the user's own captures for things that carry emotional weight. Quote marks, attributed to the date.
