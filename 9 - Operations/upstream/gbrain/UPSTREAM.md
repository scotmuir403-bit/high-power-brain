## Sync procedure

See `9 - Operations/workflows/sync upstream.md`. Short version: fetch the latest version of each tracked file at upstream HEAD, diff against the pinned copy, report changes, wait for human to adopt or dismiss, then update the pinned commit hash.

## Adoption levels

- **Yes** — we've directly written the gbrain pattern into our vault files. Diffs upstream should trigger a review of our adaptations.
- **Partial** — we've borrowed ideas but our implementation differs. Diffs upstream are informational; adopting requires redesign.
- **Reference only** — we track the file but haven't adopted anything from it yet. Diffs are informational.

## History
